<!-- Sorry for whoever has to read my notes. Its mostly so I can remember when I come back to this what is what and where stuff is....so I dont break it...more. 
And to make sure I have everything assigned that is required in the course. -->

<!--
Notes to self:
- * to change everything on the page in the css page. It looks better in white but the course requires a background color. 
- The text below the incline block works weird when the character limit exceeds a certain amount. Later I might make a different div and increase center group size. 
- If for some reason this gets image heavy, note subimages are not exported for web size.
- For the block1 header, background-color needs to be set to 0.0 or * will take over it. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp

<!--
    Assignment Check: - 6.7.2024
1. Create three HTML pages.  Each page should have a purpose within the context of your overall site. 
    1. Checked - index.html, Page2.html, Page3.html (note that our history just loops back to the index page)
2. Create at least one CSS file that provides styling for all three of your HTML pages.
    2. Checked. Style.css
3. One of your pages should have a floating element that includes both text and an image.  It should have proper margins.  Other text should wrap around that floating element.
    3. Checked. Bottom of this page. CSS has margins and text wraps around the floated image. 
4. Use Google Fonts.
    4. Two google fonts. One in the header image and the body/h2. 
5. Use span and div as shown in class.
    5. Divs used and span is used in the bottom text.
6. Modify background and foreground colors of at least one element using hexadecimal values from CSS.
    6. * uses grey hex and most divs use white hex. 
7. Apply a CSS style to an entire web page using a single CSS selector.
    7. * is used for the background and is only overridden a handful of times. 
8. Use a CSS class selector to apply a style to multiple page elements.
    8. <p class ="centergroupclass"> is used for the block text. 
9. Use a CSS hover selector to make something happen when the user places their mouse pointer over an element.
    9. <a use hover so when you hover only the link it turns black/white. ÃŸ
